## Core Philosophy

- **Iterative Improvement**: Continuously optimize skill quality through the test-evaluate-improve cycle
- **User Collaboration**: Emphasize human-AI collaboration, involving users in the evaluation process to ensure skills meet expectations
- **Quantitative Evaluation**: Provide benchmark testing and assertion verification to quantify skill performance
- **Description Optimization**: Automatically optimize skill descriptions to improve triggering accuracy

## Key Features & Workflow

1. **Capture Intent**: Understand user requirements, clarify skill goals, trigger conditions, and expected output formats
2. **Interview and Research**: Proactively ask about edge cases, input/output formats, success criteria, and dependencies
3. **Write SKILL.md**: Based on user interview results, fill in skill name, description, and detailed content
4. **Test Cases Design**: Create 2-3 realistic test prompts to verify skill effectiveness
5. **Run and Evaluate**: Run tests with and without skill in parallel, collect quantitative and qualitative data
6. **Feedback and Improve**: Iteratively improve skills based on user feedback and benchmark results
7. **Description Optimization**: Optimize the description field in SKILL.md to improve skill triggering accuracy
8. **Package and Present**: Package the final skill as a .skill file for user installation
