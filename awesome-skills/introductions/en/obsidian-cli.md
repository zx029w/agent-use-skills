## Core Philosophy

- Communicates with a running Obsidian desktop instance via IPC for zero-latency real-time operations
- All parameters use unified `key=value` syntax, with plain text output by default — perfect for Unix pipes

2. **Daily Notes**: Read today's note, append content, insert tasks into daily notes
3. **Full-Text Search**: Path-scoped search, result limits, JSON output, context-aware search
4. **Properties & Tags**: Read/write frontmatter properties, tag statistics and filtering
5. **Task Management**: Cross-vault task queries, filter by file/daily note, toggle task completion
6. **Link Analysis**: Backlinks, orphaned notes, unresolved links, dead-end detection
7. **Sync Management**: Obsidian Sync status check, version history, file restoration
