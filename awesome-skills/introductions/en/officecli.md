# OfficeCLI

**OfficeCLI** is the world's first Office suite purpose-built for AI agents, enabling them to create, read, and edit Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents with a single command. Open-source, single binary, no Office installation required, zero dependencies.

## Core Philosophy

- **AI-Native Design**: All commands support structured `--json` output, path-based addressing, and progressive complexity (L1 Read → L2 DOM → L3 Raw XML)
- **Zero Dependencies**: Single self-contained binary with embedded .NET runtime, cross-platform (macOS / Linux / Windows)
- **Built-in Rendering Engine**: No Office needed — agents can *see* their output (HTML / PNG / live preview). The render → look → fix loop works in CI, Docker, and headless environments
- **Self-Healing Workflow**: Structured error codes with suggestions enable agents to self-correct without human intervention

## Key Features & Workflow

1. **Three-Layer Architecture**: L1 semantic views (`view`) → L2 DOM operations (`get`/`set`/`add`/`remove`) → L3 raw XML (`raw`/`raw-set`)
2. **Built-in Rendering Engine**: `view html` / `view screenshot` / `watch` natively output HTML and PNG with live preview support
3. **Formula & Pivot Engine**: 150+ Excel functions auto-evaluated on write; native OOXML pivot tables with one command
4. **Template Merge**: `merge` replaces `{{key}}` placeholders — design once, fill N times
5. **Round-trip Dump**: `dump` serializes documents into replayable batch JSON for learning from existing documents
6. **MCP Server**: Built-in MCP support — register with one command for Claude Code / Cursor / VS Code etc.
7. **Resident Mode & Batch**: Keep documents in memory for near-zero latency; batch mode for atomic multi-command execution
8. **Specialized Sub-skills**: Academic papers, pitch decks, Morph animations, 3D presentations, financial models, data dashboards, and more
