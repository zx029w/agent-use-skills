## Core Philosophy

- **End-to-End Automation**: From video download to speech transcription to summary generation, the entire pipeline runs automatically without manual intervention
- **Structured Knowledge Capture**: Transforms unstructured video content into searchable, interlinked Obsidian notes for building a personal knowledge base
- **Bilingual Adaptation**: Supports both Chinese (Bilibili, Douyin, etc.) and English (YouTube, etc.) video content with intelligent language detection
- **Summary & Transcript Separation**: Generates independent summary notes and full transcript notes, linked bidirectionally via Obsidian wikilinks

## Key Features & Workflow

1. **Video Download**: Downloads videos from YouTube, Bilibili, and all yt-dlp compatible platforms, automatically extracting metadata such as title, author, and upload date
2. **Audio Extraction**: Uses ffmpeg to extract high-quality MP3 audio from video files
3. **Speech Transcription**: Converts speech to text using OpenAI Whisper (turbo model), with automatic language detection and optional manual language specification for improved accuracy on Chinese content
4. **Structured Summary Generation**: Produces a standardized summary from the transcript, including a one-line core point, key arguments, and a structured information table
5. **Obsidian Note Saving**: Automatically creates summary and transcript notes with YAML frontmatter (title, source, author, date, tags), interconnected via wikilinks
6. **Automatic Cleanup**: Removes downloaded video and audio temporary files after processing is complete
