## Core Philosophy

- **Unified Management**: Manage the entire Google ecosystem through a single `gog` command.
- **Agent-Friendly**: Supports JSON output (`--json`), allowing AI Agents to easily extract and process email content, calendar events, or spreadsheet data.
- **Security First**: Based on the OAuth authentication flow, ensuring that the Agent only performs operations within the scope authorized by the user.

## Key Features & Workflow

1. **Gmail Operations**: Supports email search (consistent with web search syntax) and sending emails.
2. **Drive Management**: Supports searching and listing files, making it easy for Agents to find reference documents.
3. **Sheets Data Interaction**: Supports reading (`get`), updating (`update`), and appending (`append`) spreadsheet data—ideal for automated record-keeping or report generation.
4. **Calendar & Contacts**: Supports viewing schedules and managing contact information.
5. **Docs Export**: Supports exporting Google Docs to formats like plain text for easy reading by the Agent.

## Skills Library Overview

- **Core Commands**: Encapsulated `gog` CLI usage covering various sub-services.
